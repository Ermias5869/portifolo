            üëã Hello! I'm Yeabsra üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, a web and mobile developer from Ethiopia.
            I taught myself how to build websites and apps, and I enjoy using
            technology to solve problems and bring ideas to life. I'm meticulous
            in my work, paying close attention to small details and finding
            creative solutions when challenges arise. When I'm not coding, I'm
            always exploring new technologies and learning something new.
          </p>

            {" "}
            I'm passionate about building projects and sharing them with others.
            I thrive on collaboration and love working with others to create
            innovative solutions and make cool stuff happen. Whether it's a
            complex web application or a sleek mobile app, I'm excited to bring
            your ideas to life. Let's connect and work together to achieve
            something amazing!
